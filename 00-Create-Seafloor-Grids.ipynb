    "This notebook generates seafloor age grids for a specified plate reconstruction model and time interval using GPlately's `SeafloorGrid` class.\n",

    "**Purpose**: Create consistent seafloor age grids that align with the plate reconstruction model being used, avoiding potential mismatches between pre-computed grids and updated rotation files.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Load plate reconstruction model (rotation files, topologies, static polygons)\n",
    "2. Configure seafloor gridding parameters (time range, resolution, output directory)\n",
    "3. Generate age grids using topological plate reconstruction\n",
    "4. Save grids to disk in NetCDF format"

    "## Notes for Future Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating other notebooks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these grids in `01-Identify-Shear-Zones.ipynb` and other workflows, update the path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agegrid_dir = \"./seafloor-grid-output/SEAFLOOR_AGE/\"\n",
    "agegrid_filename = agegrid_dir + \"seafloor_age_{:.2f}Ma.nc\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note on file naming**: \n",
    "- GPlately's `SeafloorGrid` uses `{:.2f}` format (e.g., `100.00Ma`)\n",
    "- Downloaded grids may use `{:.1f}` format (e.g., `100.0Ma`)\n",
    "- Adjust the format string in your code accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If grids don't align with plate boundaries, ensure you're using the same model name for both grid generation and subsequent analyses\n",
    "- Check that all topologies, rotation files, and static polygons are from the same model version\n",
    "- Verify time ranges match between grid generation and reconstruction model capabilities\n",
    "- If you get permission errors, ensure the output directory has write permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance tips**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use multiprocessing by running as a script rather than in interactive mode\n",
    "- Reduce grid spacing (e.g., 0.5° instead of 0.1°) for faster prototyping\n",
    "- Generate grids for smaller time ranges if full coverage isn't needed\n",
    "- The process creates intermediate files (continental masks, seed points) that can be reused if interrupted"
