The age overlaps the age of the host Roxby Downs Granite (1593.5 ± 1.2 Ma: zircon SHRIMP U-Pb; Jagodzinski, 2014) and is supported by an age of 1584 ± 20 Ma from a felsic volcanic rock interpreted to be a peperite intruded into the mineralised breccias at Olympic Dam (Johnson and Cross, 1995) and a U-Pb and Pb-Pb ages of hematite of 1592 ± 15 Ma, 1590 ± 8 Ma and 1577 ± 5 ma (Ciobanu et al., 2013; Apukhtina et al., 2017). The cited ages are in contrast to much younger ages of ~1400 Ma to ~1200 Ma proposed by Meffre et al. (2010) based on pyrite Pb data. It is likely that significant disturbance or remobilisation has effect the ores post deposition. Endowment includes production of 3.8 Mt Cu, 0.53 kt (17 Moz) Ag, 59.1 t (1.9 Moz) Au and 81 kt U3O8 and total mineral resources at 30 June 2016 of 10,400 Mt at 0.77% Cu, 250 ppm U3O8, 1 g/t Ag and 0.32 gt Au (Ehrig et al., 2017). The lanthanide oxide grades were determined using La and Ce grades of 0.17% and 0.25%, respectively (http://portergeo.com.au/database/mineinfo.asp?mineid=mn001; accessed January 2023), and unweighted averages of La/Ce for ore types with over 0.3% Cu as tabulated in Ehrig et al.
